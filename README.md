Face detection using Jetson Nano and CNN 
Face detection using the Jetson Nano involves implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful deep learning technique tailored for image-related tasks. The Jetson Nano's dedicated GPU enhances the efficiency of running complex models. Typically, a pre-trained face detection model, often based on architectures like SSD or Faster R-CNN, is employed due to the resource-intensive nature of training CNNs from scratch. The model is optimized for deployment on edge devices, considering the Jetson Nano's hardware constraints. Techniques like quantization and pruning may be applied for size and computational efficiency. The deployment is facilitated by tools such as TensorRT, which optimizes and runs deep learning models on NVIDIA GPUs. Once deployed, the model processes real-time video feeds from a connected camera, outlining detected faces. This application is relevant in various fields, including surveillance, human-computer interaction, and robotics, where the Jetson Nano's capabilities make it an ideal platform for edge-based face detection.
